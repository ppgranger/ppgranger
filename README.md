Building **software, data & AI platforms** at enterprise scale.

Strong software engineering background, with a focus on systems designed to last:
clarity over complexity, scalability over hype, execution over noise.

## What I care about
- Software architecture & distributed systems  
- Data & AI platforms, production ML & MLOps  
- Cloud & platform engineering  
- Engineering strategy, standards & governance  

## How I work
I lead engineering teams with high standards and a pragmatic mindset.
The goal is simple: build systems that run reliably, scale cleanly, and age well.

> *Engineering with craft, scale, and restraint.*
